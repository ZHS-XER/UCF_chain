    "A medium shot of a pool table with a male player standing upright behind it, observing the scattered pool balls. The balls are spread across the table, with approximately 7-8 visible, indicating play is in progress after the initial break. The player is wearing a light blue shirt. A digital scoreboard 'BCn' is visible at the top, and 'Chalk Off!' banners are behind the table.",
    "A wide shot of a pool table showing a male player bent over the table, poised to strike the cue ball. All the colored pool balls are tightly racked in a triangular formation near the far end of the table, ready for the opening break shot. The player is wearing a blue and white striped shirt. A 'BCn' scoreboard and 'Chalk Off!' banners are in the background.",
    "A wide shot of a pool table with a male player bent over, having just executed or in the immediate aftermath of a shot. The racked balls are now scattered across the table, some still in relatively close clusters, indicating the direct result of a powerful break shot. All the original balls appear to be still on the table. The player is wearing a light blue shirt, similar to frame_0. The 'BCn' scoreboard and banners are visible.",
    "A wide shot of a pool table with a male player bent over, looking down at the cue ball. The colored pool balls are neatly racked in a triangle, identical to frame_1. The player is wearing a blue and white striped shirt and appears to be in the final moments of preparation or the backswing before making the break shot. The 'BCn' scoreboard and 'Chalk Off!' banners are in the background.",
    "A medium shot of a pool table with a male player standing upright, observing the scattered pool balls. There are fewer balls visible on the table (approximately 5-6), and they are more widely dispersed than in frame_0, suggesting a later stage of the game where more balls have been pocketed. The player is wearing a light blue shirt. The 'BCn' scoreboard and 'Chalk Off!' banners are in the background."

  "reasoning": "The temporal order can be determined by observing the state of the pool balls and the player's actions, which follow a logical progression in a game of pool:\n\n1.  **Preparation for the break shot:** This is characterized by the balls being racked in a triangle and the player getting ready to strike. Frame_3 shows the player in a poised, pre-shot stance with the balls racked. Frame_1 also shows racked balls, with the player bent over, closer to the actual strike.\n2.  **Execution of the break shot:** Following preparation, the player strikes the cue ball to scatter the racked balls. Frame_1, with the player leaned in and the cue stick possibly at or near impact, represents the moment of the break shot itself, or the immediate preceding action to the strike.\n3.  **Immediate aftermath of the break:** The balls are newly scattered across the table, and the player is often still in a bent-over position. Frame_2 clearly depicts the balls scattered from the initial break, with the player still bent over the table.\n4.  **Mid-game play:** As the game progresses, balls are pocketed, and the remaining balls become more dispersed. The player stands up to survey the table and plan the next shot. Frame_0 shows the player standing, with balls scattered and fewer than the initial break, indicating some balls have been pocketed.\n5.  **Later stages of the game:** More balls have been pocketed, and the remaining balls are even more widely dispersed. Frame_4 shows the player standing, with the fewest balls on the table and the widest dispersion, signifying a more advanced stage of the game.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is: player prepares for the break (frame_3), player executes the break (frame_1), balls are scattered from the break (frame_2), ongoing play with some balls pocketed (frame_0), and later stages of play with fewer balls remaining (frame_4).",
