    "A male diver is standing on the diving board, facing away from the camera. The board is visibly bent downwards, indicating a moment of compression. The diver's body is relatively straight, looking towards the water. There's a small ripple or splash in the water directly beneath the board.",
    "The water is disturbed by a significant splash, showing ripples spreading outwards. No diver is visible on the board or immediately above the water, indicating they have already entered the pool.",
    "A male diver is standing upright on the diving board, facing away from the camera. The board appears relatively flat or only slightly bent. The diver's arms are slightly extended forward. A small ripple is visible in the water directly below the board.",
    "A male diver is airborne, just above the diving board. His body is slightly tucked with arms raised, in the midst of a jump. The diving board is significantly bent downwards and appears to be rebounding from the diver's push-off.",
    "A male diver is standing upright on the diving board, facing away from the camera. The board appears flat. The diver's arms are held close to their sides. A small ripple is visible in the water directly below the board."

  "reasoning": "The frames depict a sequence of a diver performing a dive from a springboard. I will order them based on the natural progression of a dive: initial stance, preparation/bounce, push-off/take-off, and entry into the water.\n\n1.  **Initial Stance:** Frame_4 shows the diver standing upright on a flat board with arms at their sides, representing the starting position.\n2.  **Preparation/Pre-bounce:** Frame_2 shows the diver still upright on the board, but with arms slightly forward, suggesting a subtle shift or the beginning of a preliminary bounce. The board is still relatively flat.\n3.  **Board Compression/Push Down:** Frame_0 shows the diver on the board, which is now clearly bent downwards. This represents the point of maximum compression where the diver has landed from a bounce and is preparing to spring upwards. The diver is still in contact with the board.\n4.  **Take-off/Airborne:** Frame_3 shows the diver airborne, just above the board. The board is still heavily bent downwards (rebounding), indicating the strong push-off that just occurred. The diver's body posture suggests they are initiating the dive or flip.\n5.  **Water Entry/Splash:** Frame_1 shows a significant splash in the water with no diver visible, indicating that the diver has already entered the pool.\n\nThis sequence logically follows the physics and common execution of a springboard dive.",
