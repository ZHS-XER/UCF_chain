  "frame_descriptions": [
    "A person is captured mid-air, having just jumped off the diving board. Their body is vertical, arms extended upwards, and they are positioned directly above the diving board.",
    "A person is airborne, having launched from the diving board. They are higher and further away from the board compared to frame_0, with their body in a more horizontal, slightly tucked position.",
    "A person is standing on the end of the white diving board, looking down at the pool, seemingly preparing to jump.",
    "A splash is visible in the blue swimming pool where a person has entered the water. Another swimmer is partially visible in the water on the left side. The diver is mostly or fully submerged.",
    "A person is in the process of entering the blue swimming pool. Their lower body and legs are partially submerged, creating a visible splash at the water's surface."

  "reasoning": "The sequence of events in a dive typically starts with standing on the board, followed by jumping into the air, performing a maneuver, entering the water, and finally being submerged. \n\n1.  **frame_2** shows the diver standing on the board, which is the starting point.\n2.  **frame_0** shows the diver in the air, just above the board, likely at the peak of the initial jump.\n3.  **frame_1** shows the diver further in the air, higher and more horizontally oriented, indicating a later stage of the aerial maneuver.\n4.  **frame_4** captures the moment of entry into the water, with the legs and lower body just having broken the surface, creating a splash.\n5.  **frame_3** shows the diver fully submerged, with the splash having dissipated or largely settled, indicating the final stage of the entry.",
