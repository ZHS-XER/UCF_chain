  "frame_descriptions": [
    "A person is captured mid-air, just above the diving board, with their arms raised and body in an upright position, indicating an upward trajectory immediately after pushing off the board. The diving board is visible beneath them, and the pool water is relatively calm.",
    "The person who was diving is no longer visible above the water or on the diving board. There are visible ripples and splashes on the surface of the pool water, indicating that the diver has just entered or is currently submerged in the water. The diving board is empty.",
    "A person stands on the diving board, positioned somewhat in the middle of the board's length, with their back facing the swimming pool and the camera. Their arms are down by their sides, and they appear to be in a preparatory stance or walking onto the board.",
    "A person is captured high in the air, significantly above the diving board, at what appears to be the peak of their jump. Their arms are raised overhead, and their legs are slightly bent, demonstrating a more extended position than in frame_0. The diving board is far below them.",
    "A person stands at the very edge of the diving board, facing directly towards the swimming pool. Their body is upright, and their arms are down by their sides, suggesting they are poised and ready to begin their dive. This is a clear pre-dive stance."

  "reasoning": "The sequence of events for a dive typically starts with the diver approaching the board, taking a ready position, jumping off the board, reaching the peak of their jump, and finally entering the water. \n\n1.  **frame_2** shows the person on the board, but facing away from the pool, potentially as they walk onto the board or turn.\n2.  **frame_4** then shows the person at the very edge of the board, facing the pool and poised to dive. This logically follows `frame_2` as they prepare.\n3.  **frame_0** captures the moment immediately after pushing off the board, where the diver is still relatively low but clearly in the air.\n4.  **frame_3** shows the diver at the highest point of their jump, much higher than in `frame_0`, indicating further progression of the jump.\n5.  **frame_1** is the final stage shown, where the diver has entered the water, evidenced by the ripples and their absence from the board/air.",
