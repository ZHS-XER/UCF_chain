    "A wide shot of a swimming pool with a diving board. A person is partially submerged in the water, near the diving board, creating a visible splash and ripples on the surface. The diving board is empty. On the green grass area beside the pool, another person is sitting on a red mat, facing away from the camera, next to a white folding chair.",
    "A wide shot of a swimming pool with a diving board. A person is partially submerged in the water, near the diving board. The water shows ripples, but the initial splash seems to have subsided compared to other frames. The diving board is empty. On the green grass area beside the pool, another person is sitting on a red mat.",
    "A wide shot of a swimming pool with a diving board. A diver is standing tall and straight on the diving board, arms raised high above their head, in a poised position before a dive. The water in the pool is relatively calm. A person is already in the water to the left of the frame. Another person is sitting on a red mat by the poolside.",
    "A wide shot of a swimming pool with a diving board. A diver is captured in mid-air above the water, having just left the diving board, in a tucked or bent position, performing a flip or rotation. The diving board is empty. Small splashes are visible on the water surface. A person is already in the water. Another person is sitting on a red mat by the poolside.",
    "A wide shot of a swimming pool with a diving board. A diver is on the diving board, with knees bent and arms raised, appearing to be in the process of springing upwards or initiating their jump for the dive. A person is already in the water to the left. Another person is sitting on a red mat by the poolside."

  "reasoning": "The sequence of events for a dive typically starts with preparing and jumping off the board, followed by the mid-air maneuver, and finally entering the water. \n\n1.  **Preparation/Take-off (frame_4):** The diver is on the board, with bent knees and arms raised, indicating the initial spring or push-off for the jump. This is the start of the dynamic action.\n2.  **Peak of Jump on Board (frame_2):** Following the initial push, the diver extends upwards to achieve maximum height on the board before leaving it. Frame_2 shows the diver fully extended and poised at the peak of their jump on the board.\n3.  **Mid-air Maneuver (frame_3):** After leaving the board, the diver performs the actual dive in the air. Frame_3 shows the diver in a tucked position mid-air, having left the board.\n4.  **Water Entry/Initial Splash (frame_0):** Upon completing the aerial maneuver, the diver enters the water. Frame_0 shows a significant splash and ripples, indicating the immediate impact of the diver entering the pool.\n5.  **Post-Entry/Dissipating Splash (frame_1):** As time progresses after entry, the initial splash starts to subside. Frame_1 shows the diver in the water with less turbulent ripples, suggesting a moment after the initial impact seen in frame_0.\n\nThe static person in the water and the person sitting by the pool are present in all frames and do not help in determining the order of the dive itself.",
