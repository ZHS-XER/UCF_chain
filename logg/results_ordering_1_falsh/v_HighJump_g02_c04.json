    "A male athlete, dressed in a black and white athletic uniform, is captured mid-stride during a run on a reddish indoor track. His left leg is lifted and bent, while his right foot is planted on the ground. He is looking forward, and in the background, there's a high jump setup. The words 'Boys High Jump' are displayed in white text at the bottom right.",
    "The athlete is lying on his back on a blue high jump landing mat. His legs are bent, and the red high jump bar is resting across his torso and stomach. His head is visible at the left, facing upwards. This indicates the aftermath of a jump where the bar has been knocked down.",
    "The athlete is mid-air, in an inverted position over the high jump bar. His back is facing the ground, and his legs are bent and raised towards the left side of the frame. The high jump bar is visible beneath him, still on the uprights, but he is clearly in the process of going over it. The image has a slight blur, suggesting motion.",
    "The athlete is running towards the high jump mat and bar from the left side of the frame. He is very close to the blue landing mat, with his body angled towards the bar. His left arm is bent forward, and his right arm is slightly back. The high jump bar is still in place on its uprights.",
    "A male athlete in a black and white uniform is running on a reddish track, viewed from behind and slightly to the side. He is further away from the high jump setup compared to other frames, initiating his approach. The words 'Boys High Jump' are displayed in white text at the bottom right."

  "reasoning": "The frames depict a high jump attempt. I will order them chronologically based on the phases of a high jump:\n\n1.  **Initial Approach:** The athlete starts his run from a distance.\n2.  **Mid-Approach:** The athlete continues running, getting closer to the jump area.\n3.  **Take-off/Pre-jump:** The athlete is at the take-off point, just before or during the launch.\n4.  **Clearing the Bar:** The athlete is airborne, attempting to go over the bar.\n5.  **Landing/Aftermath:** The athlete has landed on the mat, and the result of the jump (bar knocked down) is evident.\n\n-   **frame_4** shows the athlete running from furthest away, beginning the approach. This is the earliest.\n-   **frame_0** shows the athlete running, closer to the jump area than frame_4, but still on the run-up track.\n-   **frame_3** shows the athlete very close to the mat, approaching the take-off point, with the bar still intact. This is immediately before the jump.\n-   **frame_2** shows the athlete inverted over the bar in mid-air. This is the peak action of the jump.\n-   **frame_1** shows the athlete lying on the landing mat with the bar dislodged, indicating the completion of the jump and a failed attempt. This is the latest stage.",
