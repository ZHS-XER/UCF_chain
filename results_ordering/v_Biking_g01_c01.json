    "A child wearing a helmet and pads is on a bicycle in a parking lot. The camera is at a medium distance, and the child is positioned in the middle of a parking space, facing slightly to the right.",
    "A closer shot of the child on the bicycle in the parking lot. The bike's front wheel is positioned just behind a white parking line.",
    "A tight close-up shot of the child on the bicycle. A basketball hoop base is visible in the background on the left. The bike's front wheel is over a white parking line.",
    "The closest shot of the five frames, showing a side profile of the child on the bicycle. The camera is zoomed in, cutting off the top of the helmet and the bottom of the wheels.",
    "A wide shot of the child on the bicycle in a large, empty parking lot. The child is furthest from the camera in this frame, near the intersection of two white lines."
  ],
  "reasoning": "The correct temporal order is determined by tracking the child's movement and the camera's zoom. The sequence depicts a child riding a bicycle towards and past the camera.\n\n1.  **frame_4** is the starting point as it is the widest shot, showing the child furthest away from the camera.\n2.  **frame_0** follows, as the child has ridden closer to the camera, and the shot is tighter than in frame_4.\n3.  **frame_1** is next, showing the child even closer, approaching a white parking line.\n4.  **frame_2** shows the child having just crossed the white line. A basketball hoop base, not clearly visible before, appears in the background, indicating the camera is panning to follow the child's movement.\n5.  **frame_3** is the final frame. It is the tightest close-up, a side-on shot, suggesting the child is now directly beside or has just passed the camera's position.\n\nThis sequence (4, 0, 1, 2, 3) creates a logical and continuous motion of the child riding from a distance to a close-up.",
