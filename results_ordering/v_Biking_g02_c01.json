    "A tight, low-angle close-up on the legs and rear wheel of the second cyclist. The cyclist is on the far left of the frame, and the first cyclist is no longer visible.",
    "A medium shot of two cyclists riding on a paved road. They are positioned on the right side of the frame, suggesting they are just entering the scene.",
    "A medium shot of the two cyclists, who have now moved further to the left in the frame compared to other shots. The second cyclist is directly behind the first.",
    "A medium shot of the two cyclists, now positioned in the center of the frame. They are continuing their movement from right to left.",
    "A closer shot focusing on the second cyclist. The first cyclist is almost completely out of the frame on the far left, with only their rear wheel visible."
  ],
  "reasoning": "The correct temporal order is determined by tracking the cyclists' movement from right to left across the frame. In frame_1, the cyclists are on the right side of the frame, indicating the start of the action. In frame_3, they have moved to the center of the frame. In frame_2, they have progressed further to the left. Frame_4 shows a shift in perspective, getting closer to the second cyclist as the first one is almost out of the frame. Finally, frame_0 is the last in the sequence, showing a tight close-up of the second cyclist just before they exit the frame completely. This sequence (1, 3, 2, 4, 0) represents a smooth and continuous motion.",
