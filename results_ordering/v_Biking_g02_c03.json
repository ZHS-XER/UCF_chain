    "A cyclist on a time trial bike is captured mid-pedal stroke. The right leg is in the lower-front quadrant of its rotation, descending or just past the bottom, while the left leg is in the upper-rear quadrant, ascending. The cyclist is leaning forward in an aerodynamic position, wearing a white jersey and black shorts. The bike features disc wheels at the rear and a spoked front wheel. The background is blurred, suggesting motion, with trees and a light-colored road visible.",
    "The cyclist is shown with the right leg positioned very low, appearing to be at or near the bottom of its pedal stroke and beginning to rise. Conversely, the left leg is at or near the top of its stroke, beginning its descent. The rider maintains an aggressive, aerodynamic tuck. The bike is tilted slightly to the viewer's right. The road surface and blurred background indicate movement.",
    "This frame shows the cyclist with the right leg clearly ascending, past the lowest point but not yet at the top. The left leg is descending, past the top but not yet at the bottom. The cyclist's body position is consistent with high-speed cycling. The bike and background elements are similar to other frames, indicating continuous motion.",
    "The cyclist's right leg is at its highest point in the pedal stroke (crank arm pointing roughly 1 o'clock), while the left leg is at its lowest point (crank arm pointing roughly 7 o'clock). The rider is intensely focused, in a deep aerodynamic tuck. The bike is a time trial specific model with disc wheels and aero bars. The scene is outdoors on what appears to be a paved road, with blurred trees in the background.",
    "The cyclist's right leg is descending from its peak (crank arm pointing roughly 2 o'clock), and the left leg is ascending from its trough (crank arm pointing roughly 8 o'clock). This position indicates a moment shortly after the right leg has reached its maximum height. The overall posture, bike type, and background are consistent with the other frames."

  "reasoning": "The primary method for ordering these frames is to track the position of the cyclist's legs, specifically the pedal stroke, as it represents a continuous cyclical motion. I focused on the right leg's position relative to the pedal cycle:\n\n1.  **Frame 3:** The right leg is at its highest point in the pedal stroke (approximately 1 o'clock). This marks the beginning of the downward push for the right leg and the end of the upward motion for the left leg.\n2.  **Frame 4:** The right leg has begun its descent from the peak (approximately 2 o'clock). The left leg has begun its ascent from the bottom. This clearly follows frame 3.\n3.  **Frame 0:** The right leg is further down in its descent (approximately 4-5 o'clock). The left leg is further up in its ascent. This logically follows frame 4.\n4.  **Frame 1:** The right leg is at or very near its lowest point (approximately 5-6 o'clock), about to begin its ascent. The left leg is at or very near its highest point, about to begin its descent. This follows frame 0.\n5.  **Frame 2:** The right leg is now clearly ascending from its lowest point (approximately 8-9 o'clock). The left leg is descending. This position occurs after the right leg has passed its lowest point (frame 1) and before it reaches its peak (frame 3), thus completing the cycle.\n\nThis sequence provides a smooth, continuous progression of the pedaling motion.",
