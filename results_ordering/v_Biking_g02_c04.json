    "A cyclist in an aero position, wearing a blue helmet, white short-sleeved jersey, and black arm sleeves and shorts, is seen from the right side. The right pedal is high, approximately at the 1-2 o'clock position, indicating it's starting its downward stroke. The left pedal is relatively low, around the 7-8 o'clock position, beginning its upward recovery. The front wheel has visible spokes, and the rear wheel is a solid disk. The background is a blurry natural setting with trees.",
    "A cyclist in an aero position, similar to other frames. The right pedal is near the top of its rotation, approximately at the 11-12 o'clock position. The left pedal is near the bottom, around the 5-6 o'clock position. The front wheel shows visible spokes, and the rear wheel is a solid disk. The background is blurred trees.",
    "A cyclist in a deep aero position. The right pedal is at its lowest point, approximately at the 6 o'clock position. The left pedal is at its highest point, around the 12 o'clock position. The cyclist is wearing a blue helmet. The front wheel has visible spokes, and the rear wheel is a solid disk. The background shows blurred trees.",
    "A cyclist in an aero position, slightly after the lowest point of the right pedal. The right pedal has moved up to approximately the 7-8 o'clock position, and the left pedal has moved down to about the 1-2 o'clock position. The front wheel has visible spokes, and the rear wheel is a solid disk. The background is a blurry natural setting.",
    "A cyclist in an aero position, further along in the pedaling cycle than frame_3. The right pedal is higher, around the 9-10 o'clock position, and the left pedal is lower, around the 3-4 o'clock position. The front wheel has visible spokes, and the rear wheel is a solid disk. The background is blurred trees."

  "reasoning": "The primary cue for ordering these frames is the continuous motion of the pedals during a cycling stroke. I will track the position of the right pedal (and consequently the left pedal, as they are opposite) around the crank's rotation.\n\n1.  **Frame_2** clearly shows the right pedal at its absolute lowest point (approximately 6 o'clock) and the left pedal at its highest (12 o'clock). This provides a definitive starting reference for the pedaling cycle, where the left leg is about to initiate a powerful downward stroke.\n2.  Following **Frame_2**, the right pedal will start moving upwards, and the left pedal will move downwards. **Frame_3** shows the right pedal having moved slightly up (around 7-8 o'clock) and the left pedal slightly down (around 1-2 o'clock), consistent with the left leg beginning its push.\n3.  Continuing this motion, **Frame_4** shows the right pedal further up (around 9-10 o'clock) and the left pedal further down (around 3-4 o'clock). The left leg is in the middle of its power stroke.\n4.  Next, the right pedal would be approaching its highest point, and the left pedal its lowest. **Frame_1** depicts the right pedal near the top (11-12 o'clock) and the left pedal near the bottom (5-6 o'clock). This indicates the left leg is finishing its power stroke.\n5.  Finally, after reaching the top, the right pedal starts its downward motion, and the left pedal starts its upward motion. **Frame_0** shows the right pedal having moved past the top to about the 1-2 o'clock position (beginning its downward stroke), and the left pedal is rising (around 7-8 o'clock). This completes a significant portion of the pedaling cycle, leading back towards the state in Frame_2 for the left pedal's ascent and right pedal's descent.\n\nThe body posture and background remain consistent enough across frames to confirm they are sequential moments of a single action.",
