    "frame_0: Two cyclists are riding on a paved road, viewed from a slightly elevated rear-left perspective. The lead cyclist, wearing a white short-sleeved top and black shorts with black long sleeves underneath, is on the left side of the frame. Their right pedal is slightly past the 6 o'clock position, moving upwards. The second cyclist, wearing a red and white patterned top and black shorts, is slightly behind and to the right. Both bikes have disc-like rear wheels. Trees with bare branches line the background, and there's a visible yellow line on the left edge of the road.",
    "frame_1: The scene is similar to frame_0. The lead cyclist's right pedal is now higher, positioned around the 2-3 o'clock mark, indicating it's moving through the upward part of the stroke. The overall positions of the cyclists and the background are consistent, with subtle forward progression.",
    "frame_2: The scene continues to show the two cyclists. The lead cyclist's right pedal is now at its highest point, approximately at the 12 o'clock position. The cyclist appears to have moved slightly further forward compared to the previous frames.",
    "frame_3: In this frame, the lead cyclist's right pedal has begun its descent, now positioned around the 3 o'clock mark. The cyclist maintains their forward motion on the road, with the companion cyclist following.",
    "frame_4: This frame shows the two cyclists with the lead cyclist's right pedal at its lowest point, directly at the 6 o'clock position. This appears to be the beginning of the upward phase of the pedal stroke."

  "reasoning": "I determined the temporal order by observing the cyclical motion of the lead cyclist's right pedal. By tracking the pedal's position through a full revolution, I could establish the sequence.\n\n1.  **frame_4:** The pedal is at its lowest point (6 o'clock). This logically marks the start of an upward stroke.\n2.  **frame_0:** The pedal has moved slightly past the 6 o'clock position, continuing its upward motion.\n3.  **frame_1:** The pedal has risen further, now around the 2-3 o'clock position.\n4.  **frame_2:** The pedal reaches its highest point, around the 12 o'clock position.\n5.  **frame_3:** The pedal begins its downward motion, now positioned around the 3 o'clock mark.\n\nThis sequence of pedal positions forms a coherent and continuous progression of one part of the pedal stroke, indicating the chronological order of the frames.",
