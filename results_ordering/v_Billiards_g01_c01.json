    "A wide shot of a blue billiards table during a game. A player is visible in the upper center, holding a cue stick, with the cue ball positioned behind the head string. The other colored balls are tightly racked in a triangle formation near the foot spot. The player's cue stick is close to the cue ball, appearing to be just before or at the moment of impact for the break shot. A scoreboard in the lower right indicates 'U.S. Open 9-Ball Championship' and scores Mika Immonen 5, Ronnie Alcano 8.",
    "A wide shot of the blue billiards table immediately after the break shot. The cue ball has struck the racked balls, and all the balls are now widely scattered across the table, many with visible motion blur, indicating they are in active movement. The player's cue stick is in a follow-through position, elevated above where the cue ball was. The scoreboard is mostly obscured by the scattered balls, but the top portion is still visible.",
    "A wide shot of a blue billiards table, similar to frame_0. A player is positioned in the upper center, holding a cue stick over the cue ball, which is placed behind the head string. The other colored balls are perfectly racked in a triangle formation. The player's cue stick is further back in the backswing, indicating they are preparing to strike the cue ball. The scoreboard is fully visible, showing the same scores as frame_0.",
    "A wide shot of the blue billiards table. The balls are now scattered across the table and appear to be largely settled or moving very slowly after the break shot. The cue ball is near the left rail, just below the head string. The player's cue stick is no longer actively involved in the shot. The scoreboard is partially visible, obscured by some of the balls.",
    "A wide shot of the blue billiards table. The balls are scattered across the table and appear to be fully settled after the break shot. The cue ball is positioned slightly further to the left, closer to the left rail than in frame_3. The player is not actively engaged with the cue stick. The scoreboard is partially visible, obscured by some of the balls."

  "reasoning": "The sequence of events for a billiards break shot typically involves: initial setup and backswing, then the strike, followed by the scattering of balls, and finally the balls settling into their new positions. \n\n1.  **Frame 2:** Shows the player in the deepest part of their backswing, with the cue ball positioned for the break and the rack of balls completely intact. This represents the earliest stage of preparing for the shot.\n2.  **Frame 0:** Shows the player with the cue stick closer to the cue ball, poised to strike or just at the moment of impact. The rack is still intact, but the player's action is more advanced than in frame 2.\n3.  **Frame 1:** Clearly depicts the immediate aftermath of the break. The cue ball has hit the rack, and all the balls are actively scattering across the table, indicated by motion blur. The player's cue stick is in a follow-through.\n4.  **Frame 3:** The balls are scattered but mostly settled. The active motion seen in frame 1 has subsided. The cue ball is in a new position, near the left rail.\n5.  **Frame 4:** The balls are fully settled, and the cue ball's position is slightly different from frame 3 (further towards the left rail), indicating a very short elapsed time after frame 3 as the last bit of movement subsides, or just a slightly later moment after the balls have come to rest.\n\nTherefore, the logical progression is from the setup, to the strike, to the scattering, and finally to the settled state.",
