    "A wide shot of a pool table during a professional match. A player in a black shirt is leaning over the table, preparing to make a break shot. The cue ball is positioned at the head string, and the 9-ball rack is perfectly set at the foot spot. Overhead banners advertise 'Chalk-Off!' and 'BCn'. A scoreboard overlay at the bottom right indicates 'U.S. Open 9-Ball Championship' and 'Race to 11 Games', with no current scores displayed for Mika Immonen or Ronnie Alcano.",
    "A wide shot of the pool table with the player standing upright in the middle of the frame, looking at the table. Several object balls are scattered across the blue felt, indicating that the game is in progress after a break. Specifically, the #2 (blue) ball is missing, meaning it has been pocketed. There are 8 object balls remaining on the table. The background elements and overlays are consistent with frame_0, including the 'Chalk-Off!' banners and 'BCn' logo.",
    "Similar to frame_0, this is a wide shot of a pool table with a player preparing for a break shot. The cue ball is at the head string and the 9-ball rack is set. However, the scoreboard overlay now displays updated scores: 'Mika Immonen 6' and 'Ronnie Alcano 9', still under 'U.S. Open 9-Ball Championship' and 'Race to 11 Games'. The overall setting is identical to the other frames.",
    "A wide shot of the pool table with a player leaning over, in a shooting stance. All 9 object balls are scattered across the table, along with the cue ball. This arrangement suggests it's immediately after a break shot. The player appears to be aiming for one of the balls. The background and overlay elements are consistent with the other frames.",
    "A wide shot of the pool table, similar to frame_1. The player is standing upright, observing the scattered balls on the table. Compared to frame_1, fewer object balls are present on the table; specifically, the #2 (blue) and #7 (brown) balls are missing, indicating two balls have been pocketed. There are 7 object balls remaining. The setting, banners, and overlays are the same as the other frames."

  "reasoning": "The key to ordering these frames lies in understanding the progression of a 9-ball pool game and the visible score changes.\n\n1.  **Start of a game/match (Break Shot):** Frames 0 and 2 show a break shot with the balls racked. Frame 0 displays 'Race to 11 Games' but no current scores for the players. This indicates it's the very beginning of a game, likely the first game shown or the beginning of the match before scores accumulate or are displayed. Frame 2, however, shows scores of 'Mika Immonen 6' and 'Ronnie Alcano 9', which means several games have already been played. Therefore, Frame 0 must come before Frame 2 in the overall match timeline.\n\n2.  **Progression within a single game (Scattered Balls and Ball Count):** Frames 1, 3, and 4 show balls scattered on the table, indicating that play is underway after a break. The number of object balls on the table allows us to sequence these frames:\n    *   **Frame 3:** Shows all 9 object balls scattered on the table. This state occurs immediately after a successful break shot where no balls (or only the cue ball) went in, or a ball was pocketed but all other balls are still on the table. The player is in a shooting stance, indicating active play.\n    *   **Frame 1:** Shows 8 object balls on the table (the #2 ball is missing). This means one ball has been pocketed since the break. The player is standing upright.\n    *   **Frame 4:** Shows 7 object balls on the table (the #2 and #7 balls are missing). This indicates further progress in the game, with two balls pocketed. The player is also standing upright.\n\nCombining these observations:\n*   **Frame 0** is the earliest point, representing a new game at an early stage of the match (no scores shown).\n*   **Frame 3** follows directly from the break in Frame 0 (or a similar break), as all 9 object balls are scattered on the table.\n*   **Frame 1** follows Frame 3, as one object ball has been pocketed (8 remaining).\n*   **Frame 4** follows Frame 1, as an additional object ball has been pocketed (7 remaining), showing further progression in the *same* game.\n*   **Frame 2** is the latest point, showing a break shot for a *new* game, but with significant score progression (6-9) from the initial state shown in Frame 0, indicating that the game(s) depicted in frames 0, 3, 1, and 4 have concluded, and several more games have been played to reach these scores.",
