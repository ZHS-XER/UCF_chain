    "A wide shot of a pool table with a player leaning over to take a shot. All 9 balls are racked in a triangle formation at the far end of the table, and the cue ball is positioned at the head string. A digital scoreboard in the bottom right corner shows \"U.S. Open 9-Ball Championship Semi-Final Match\" with scores: MIKA IMMONEN 6, RONNIE ALCANO 10. Background banners for 'PoolTableCleaner.com Chalk-Off!' are visible.",
    "A wide shot of the pool table from the same angle. The balls are now scattered across the table, with no distinct formation. No player is actively taking a shot; only the upper part of a person's body is visible at the top of the frame, standing or moving. The scoreboard overlay is not present.",
    "A wide shot of the pool table, similar to frame_1. The balls are scattered across the table, in slightly different positions compared to frame_1. The player's upper body is still visible at the top. The scoreboard overlay is not present.",
    "A wide shot of a pool table with a player leaning over to take a shot, identical to frame_0 and frame_4 in terms of player position and ball setup. All 9 balls are racked in a triangle formation, and the cue ball is at the head string. The scoreboard overlay in the bottom right corner is partially cut off, with only the title \"U.S. Open 9-Ball Championship Semi-Final Match\" clearly visible, and the player names and scores mostly obscured or off-screen.",

  "reasoning": "The core task is to order the events of a pool game: racking the balls, breaking, and then subsequent ball movement. \n\n1.  **Initial State (Racked Balls):** Frames 0, 3, and 4 all depict the balls racked in a triangle, with a player poised to take the break shot. These represent the beginning of a new rack.\n    *   Frames 0 and 4 are absolutely identical, showing the score Mika Immonen 6, Ronnie Alcano 10. They represent the same moment in time.\n    *   Frame 3 also shows the balls racked and the player poised, but the scoreboard overlay is slightly cut off or rendered differently. This subtle difference suggests it might be a slightly earlier or later moment than frames 0/4, possibly when the overlay was just appearing or had a rendering issue. Given the need to order 5 distinct frames, it's logical to place Frame 3 first among the 'racked' states as a moment where the display was not fully settled, followed by the fully rendered identical states.\n\n2.  **Subsequent State (Scattered Balls):** Frames 1 and 2 show the balls scattered across the table, which occurs after the break shot. The player is no longer in a shooting stance but is standing or moving, observing the table. The score overlay is absent.\n\n3.  **Ordering Scattered States (Frame 1 vs. Frame 2):** To order these, I looked for subtle changes in ball positions:\n    *   **Red Ball (solid):** In Frame 1, the red ball is close to the bottom-right corner pocket, almost touching the bottom rail. In Frame 2, the red ball has moved significantly further up the right rail, away from the pocket.\n    *   **Pink/Purple Ball (solid):** In Frame 1, this ball is near the top rail, slightly to the left of the center. In Frame 2, it has moved to the right of the center along the top rail.\n    *   **9-ball (light yellow):** In Frame 1, it's on the middle-left side. In Frame 2, it's slightly higher and more central.\n    The consistent movement of multiple balls (especially the red ball moving away from the pocket and further up the rail) indicates that Frame 2 represents a later moment in time than Frame 1, as balls continue to roll and settle or are affected by subsequent very rapid impacts after the initial break.\n\n**Final Sequence Derivation:**\n*   The game starts with the setup (frames 0, 3, 4).\n*   Frame 3, with its slightly different score overlay, is a plausible start for the setup phase.\n*   Frames 0 and 4, being identical and showing the full score, represent the clear, stable setup just before the break. Since we need to use both, they can be seen as two sequential moments leading up to the break, where no visual change happened on the table itself.\n*   The break shot happens (not shown as an intermediate frame).\n*   The balls scatter. Frame 1 shows an earlier state of scattered balls.\n*   Frame 2 shows a later state of scattered balls, with noticeable movement of several balls compared to Frame 1.\n\nThis leads to the chronological order: Frame 3 -> Frame 0 -> Frame 4 -> Frame 1 -> Frame 2.",
