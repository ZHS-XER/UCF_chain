    "A high-angle shot of a pool table showing all the billiard balls racked in a diamond shape at the center. The white cue ball is positioned near the top rail, and a player's hand and cue stick are visible, poised for a break shot. A scoreboard overlay is visible on the right side of the screen, but the text is blurred and unreadable. The bottom of the screen has a 'DIAMOND BilliardClub.net' logo.",

    "A high-angle shot of the pool table after a break shot. The billiard balls are scattered across the table, some near the pockets, indicating the shot has just been made or is in progress. One pink/red ball is visibly rolling towards the bottom left pocket. The player's cue stick is still extended from the shot. The scoreboard overlay is no longer visible.",

  "reasoning": "The core task is to identify the progression of a pool shot. Frames 0, 1, 3, and 4 all depict the initial state of a pool game: the balls are racked, the cue ball is in position, and a player is about to execute a break shot. Frame 2, in contrast, shows the balls scattered across the table with the cue stick still extended, clearly indicating that the break shot has already occurred or is in progress. Therefore, frame 2 must be the final event in the sequence.\n\nNow, let's order frames 0, 1, 3, and 4. Frames 1, 3, and 4 are visually identical, including the clear and readable scoreboard displaying game information. Frame 0 shows the exact same physical setup (racked balls, cue ball, player's stance) as frames 1, 3, and 4, but its scoreboard text is blurred. This suggests that frame 0 might represent a slightly earlier moment when the on-screen graphics were still loading, transitioning, or had a momentary display issue, compared to the stable and clear display in frames 1, 3, and 4. Thus, it's logical to place frame 0 before frames 1, 3, and 4.\n\nSince frames 1, 3, and 4 are identical, their relative temporal order cannot be definitively determined from the visual information alone. However, as they all represent the same 'pre-break, clear scoreboard' state and occur before the break shot itself, they should be placed sequentially after frame 0 and before frame 2. I will place them in ascending numerical order for consistency (1 then 3 then 4).\n\nCombining these observations, the most logical temporal order is: frame 0 (blurred scoreboard, pre-break) -> frame 1 (clear scoreboard, pre-break) -> frame 3 (clear scoreboard, pre-break) -> frame 4 (clear scoreboard, pre-break) -> frame 2 (balls scattered, post-break).",
