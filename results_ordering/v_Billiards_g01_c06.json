    "A pool player is leaning over a light blue pool table, aiming at the white cue ball with a cue stick. A tightly packed rack of colored object balls is visible at the far end of the table. The player is wearing an orange shirt. Text overlays include 'PoolTableCleaner.com', 'Chalk-Off!', 'BCn', and a partially visible 'RACK 12'. The player's left arm is angled, and their head is relatively low.",
    "The pool table is shown with the player standing upright, away from the table, indicating a shot has just been taken or completed. Several colored object balls are scattered across the table, some near pockets. The racked formation is gone. There are fewer balls on the table compared to frame_4.",

The player is wearing an orange shirt. Text overlays include 'PoolTableCleaner.com', 'Chalk-Off!', 'BCn', and a clear 'RACK 12'. The player's left arm is more vertical than in frame_0, and their head is slightly higher, indicating a refined aiming position.",
    "This frame is virtually identical to frame_2. A pool player is leaning over a light blue pool table, aiming at the white cue ball with a cue stick. A tightly packed rack of colored object balls is visible at the far end of the table. The player is wearing an orange shirt. Text overlays include 'PoolTableCleaner.com', 'Chalk-Off!', 'BCn', and a clear 'RACK 12'. The player's left arm is vertical, and their head is slightly higher.",
    "The pool table is shown with the player standing upright, away from the table, similar to frame_1. The colored object balls are scattered across the table, following a break shot. The racked formation is gone. There are more balls on the table compared to frame_1, indicating an earlier stage of play after the break."

  "reasoning": "The core of this problem is to sequence a pool game. The typical progression is: player sets up for the break shot (balls racked) -> player takes the break shot -> balls scatter -> play continues with balls being pocketed. \n\n1.  **Initial Setup / Aiming (Before Break):** Frames 0, 2, and 3 show the player preparing for the break shot with the balls racked. \n    *   Frames 2 and 3 are virtually identical, showing the player in a settled aiming position with clear 'RACK 12' text. \n    *   Frame 0 shows the player in a slightly different aiming pose (head lower, left arm more angled) and a partially cut-off 'RACK 12' text. This subtle difference suggests frame 0 is an earlier moment in the aiming process, with the player still adjusting, before settling into the more precise stance seen in frames 2 and 3. Therefore, 0 should come before 2 and 3.\n\n2.  **After Break (Balls Scattered):** Frames 1 and 4 show the balls scattered across the table, with the player standing upright, indicating the break shot has already occurred. \n    *   To determine their order, we compare the number of balls on the table. In pool, balls are pocketed as the game progresses. \n    *   Frame 4 clearly has more object balls on the table (approximately 8 visible) compared to frame 1 (approximately 6 visible). This means frame 4 represents the immediate aftermath of the break (or an early stage of play), while frame 1 represents a later stage where more balls have been pocketed.\n\nCombining these observations, the most logical temporal order is:\n*   **frame_0:** Player adjusting aim for the break.\n*   **frame_2, frame_3:** Player in final aiming stance for the break (these two are almost identical, representing the same moment or very close in time).\n*   **frame_4:** Balls scattered after the break, many balls still on the table.\n*   **frame_1:** Later in the game, fewer balls on the table after some have been pocketed.\n\nTherefore, the order is 0, 2, 3, 4, 1.",
