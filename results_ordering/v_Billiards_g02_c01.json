    "A pool player is executing a break shot. There is a motion blur from the cue stick indicating it has just struck the cue ball. The object balls are still tightly packed in the rack at the far end of the table, just as they are about to scatter.",
    "A pool player is in the final moments of aiming for a break shot. The cue stick's tip is extremely close to the cue ball, which is at the near end of the table. The object balls are racked at the far end. A scoreboard is visible in the lower right.",
    "A pool player is aiming for a break shot. They are leaning over the blue-felted pool table, with the cue stick pulled back slightly from the cue ball. The object balls are in a rack at the far end. A scoreboard is visible.",
    "The break shot is complete, and the pool balls are scattered across the blue-felted table. The player is standing up straight, observing the layout of the balls. The cue ball is near the left rail, about midway down the table.",
    "A pool player continues to aim for a break shot. They are leaning over the table, and the cue stick is positioned closer to the cue ball than in the previous aiming frame but not as close as the final position. A scoreboard is visible."

  "reasoning": "The logical sequence of events in a pool break shot is aiming, striking the cue ball, and the subsequent scattering of the object balls. \n1. **Aiming Phase:** Frames 2, 4, and 1 all show the player aiming before the shot. By observing the position of the cue stick relative to the cue ball, we can determine their order. In frame_2, the cue stick is pulled back slightly, typical of a practice stroke or the start of the backswing. In frame_4, the cue stick has moved closer to the cue ball. In frame_1, the cue stick is at its most forward position, just before making contact. Therefore, the aiming sequence is 2 -> 4 -> 1.\n2. **Impact Phase:** Frame_0 shows the moment of the shot itself. The motion blur of the cue stick clearly indicates that it is in motion, striking the cue ball. The object balls have not yet scattered, placing this frame immediately after the final aiming position in frame_1.\n3. **Aftermath Phase:** Frame_3 shows the result of the break. The balls are now scattered all over the table, and the player is standing up to assess the new layout. This is the clear final state of the action sequence.",
