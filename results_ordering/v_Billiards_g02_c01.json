    "This frame shows a wide shot of the pool table with numerous object balls scattered across its surface. The cue ball is visible near the top left pocket. A player in a black shirt is standing upright behind the table, looking towards the balls, with one hand near their head, seemingly contemplating the next shot or observing the result of a previous one. Two 'Chalk-Off!' banners are prominently displayed in the background.",
    "This frame captures a player bent over the pool table, holding a cue stick, with the cue ball positioned in front of a tightly racked cluster of object balls, suggesting a break shot setup. The player appears to be aiming or in the initial stage of their shot. A score overlay at the bottom right indicates 'US Open 9-Ball Championship' with 'SHANE VAN BOENING 10' and 'JOSE PARICA 8', and 'Race to 11 Games'.",
    "Similar to frame_1, the player is leaning over the table, holding the cue stick, with the cue ball aligned to hit the racked balls. The player's posture suggests an active aiming process, with the cue stick slightly more advanced towards the cue ball compared to frame_1. The score overlay is identical to frame_1.",
    "This frame is very similar to frame_2, showing the player precisely aimed with the cue stick positioned directly at the cue ball, just before or at the very moment of contact for the break shot. The player's focus is evident, and the cue stick appears to be static for an instant before the strike. The score overlay is identical.",
    "This frame shows the dynamic moment of the shot. The cue stick is blurred due to motion, indicating that the player has just struck the cue ball, which is now clearly in motion towards the racked balls. The racked balls are still intact, but the cue ball is moving towards them. The player's body is still in a follow-through position. The score overlay is identical to the other frames with the player aiming."

  "reasoning": "The frames depict a sequence of a pool player taking a shot, specifically a break shot given the racked balls. \n\n1.  **Preparation/Aiming (frame_1, frame_2, frame_3):** These frames show the player in various stages of aiming. Frame_1 shows the player initially setting up and aiming with the cue stick slightly further back. Frame_2 shows the player further leaning in and the cue stick moving closer to the cue ball. Frame_3 shows the player precisely positioned, with the cue tip at the cue ball, just before contact or at the very beginning of the strike.\n2.  **Impact/Follow-through (frame_4):** This frame clearly shows the cue stick in motion (indicated by blur), having just struck the cue ball, and the cue ball itself is now moving towards the racked object balls. This is the immediate action of the shot.\n3.  **Result/Aftermath (frame_0):** This frame shows the pool table with balls scattered across it, and the player standing upright, observing the outcome of the shot. This logically comes after the strike and subsequent movement of the balls.",
