    "frame_0: A billiards player in a striped shirt is bent over a pool table, aiming a cue stick at a perfectly racked pyramid of object balls near the center of the blue felt. The white cue ball is positioned just behind the head string, ready for an opening break shot.",
    "frame_1: A billiards player in a light blue shirt is standing upright behind the head of the pool table, holding a cue stick. The object balls are widely scattered across the table, and one red ball is visible resting inside the far-right corner pocket, indicating a successful shot has been made.",
    "frame_2: A billiards player in a striped shirt is bent over the pool table, cue in hand, aiming at a racked pyramid of object balls. The rack appears slightly less perfectly arranged than in frame_0, and the white cue ball is positioned further back on the table, closer to the rail, also indicating a break shot setup.",
    "frame_3: A billiards player in a light blue shirt is bent over the pool table, aiming with a cue stick. The object balls are scattered across the table, but still somewhat clustered towards the center where the rack would have been. This suggests an early stage of play after the break.",
    "frame_4: A billiards player in a light blue shirt is standing upright near the head of the pool table, holding a cue stick. The object balls are more widely scattered across the table than in frame_3, but not as dispersed as in frame_1, and no balls are visibly in pockets. The player appears to be surveying the table."

  "reasoning": "The temporal order is determined by the progression of a standard billiards game, primarily focusing on the state of the balls on the table (from racked to scattered, and then with pocketed balls) and the player's actions (setting up, aiming, standing). I've also considered the consistency of the players' attire to group similar actions.\n\n1.  **frame_0:** This image shows the balls in a perfectly tight rack, and the player (striped shirt) is positioned for what appears to be the initial break shot. This is the logical starting point for any game.\n2.  **frame_2:** This image also shows the balls racked and the same player (striped shirt) preparing for a shot. Compared to frame_0, the rack might be slightly less perfect, and the cue ball is in a different break position (further back). If this is part of the same game, it could represent a re-rack due to a foul on the initial break, or a subsequent break attempt. It must precede any scattering of the balls.\n3.  **frame_3:** After the break shot (from either frame_0 or frame_2), the balls would scatter. This frame shows the first stage of scattered balls, still somewhat clustered in the center. A different player (light blue shirt) is now at the table, actively aiming for a shot. This indicates the game is in progress after a successful break.\n4.  **frame_4:** The balls are now more widely scattered than in frame_3. The player (light blue shirt) is standing, indicating a shot has likely just been made, and they are assessing the table for the next move. This is a progression from the aiming state in frame_3.\n5.  **frame_1:** This frame represents the most advanced stage. The balls are very widely scattered, and critically, one ball is visible inside a pocket. The player (light blue shirt) is standing, indicating successful play and further progression in the game.\n\nThe sequence `0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1` logically follows the flow from initial setup (break), through a possible re-rack, to increasingly scattered balls on the table, culminating in a ball being pocketed.",
