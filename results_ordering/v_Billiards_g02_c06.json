    "A player is in the process of taking a break shot on a blue-felt pool table. The cue stick shows motion blur as it strikes or has just struck the cue ball, which is now moving towards the racked colored balls. The balls are slightly disturbed from their perfect rack formation. Two 'Chalk-Off!' banners are visible above the table. No scoreboard is visible.",
    "A player is aiming at a rack of colored balls at one end of the pool table, with the cue ball positioned for a break shot at the other end. The player is leaning over the table, holding the cue stick, in a ready stance. A scoreboard is visible on the right, displaying 'U.S. Open 9-Ball Championship' and scores: 'SHANE VAN BOENING 10' and 'JOSE PARICA 8'.",
    "The pool table shows the colored balls scattered across the felt, indicating that a shot (likely a break shot) has already occurred. The player is standing upright, observing the scattered balls. No scoreboard is visible.",
    "A player is aiming at a rack of colored balls at one end of the pool table, with the cue ball positioned for a break shot. The player is leaning over the table, holding the cue stick, in a ready stance, very similar to frame 1. A scoreboard is visible on the right, identical to frame 1.",
    "A player is aiming at a rack of colored balls at one end of the pool table, with the cue ball positioned for a break shot. The player is leaning over the table, holding the cue stick, in a ready stance, appearing identical to frame 3. A scoreboard is visible on the right, identical to frame 1 and 3."

  "reasoning": "The sequence of events in a pool break shot is: aiming/setup, then the strike, then the balls scattering. \n\n1.  **Initial Setup/Aiming:** Frames 1, 3, and 4 all show the player aiming at the racked balls before the break shot. They all have the scoreboard visible, showing the game details.\n    *   Comparing these three frames, frames 3 and 4 appear visually identical in terms of the player's posture and cue stick position. Frame 1 shows a very slightly different body posture, particularly the player's right arm and head position, suggesting it might be a moment just before the final 'set' aiming position.\n    *   Therefore, the most logical progression for the aiming phase is frame 1 (initial aim), followed by frame 3 (final adjustment/set position), and then frame 4 (holding the set position, as it's identical to 3).\n\n2.  **The Strike:** Frame 0 clearly shows the player in the act of striking the cue ball. The cue stick has motion blur, and the racked balls are starting to disperse, indicating the impact has just occurred or is happening.\n\n3.  **Aftermath:** Frame 2 shows the balls scattered across the table and the player standing up, observing the result of the shot. This is clearly the state after the break shot has been completed.\n\nCombining these observations leads to the sequence: frame 1 (initial aim) -> frame 3 (final aim) -> frame 4 (holding aim) -> frame 0 (the strike) -> frame 2 (balls scattered).",
