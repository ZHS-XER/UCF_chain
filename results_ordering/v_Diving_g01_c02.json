    "A medium shot of a person in a red swimsuit standing on a diving board in an indoor swimming pool. The person's back is to the camera, and they are facing the water. Their body is straight, and arms are down. There's a small splash or ripple visible in the water directly below the diver's feet. The diving board is slightly flexed downwards. A 'INDIANA' sign is visible on the main diving platform in the background, with spectators seated further back.",
    "A medium shot of the same person on the diving board, now in a crouched position, with knees bent and arms slightly raised, indicating preparation for a jump. The diving board appears more significantly flexed downwards than in other frames, and there is a larger, more active splash/ripple pattern in the water directly beneath the diver. The 'INDIANA' sign and spectators are visible in the background.",
    "A medium shot of the swimming pool after the dive. The person is no longer on the diving board or visible above the water. A large, prominent splash of water is seen where the diver would have entered the pool, with white foam and turbulent water. The diving board has sprung back to its original position. The 'INDIANA' sign and spectators are visible in the background.",
    "A medium shot of the person in the red swimsuit standing on the diving board, similar to frame_0. Their back is to the camera, body straight, and arms down. A small splash or ripple is visible in the water directly below the diver's feet, slightly less defined than in frame_0. The diving board is slightly flexed downwards. The 'INDIANA' sign and spectators are visible in the background.",
    "A medium shot of the person in the red swimsuit standing on the diving board, similar to frames_0 and frame_3. Their back is to the camera, body straight, and arms down. The water directly below the diver's feet appears relatively calm with minimal disturbance, showing only a very slight ripple at the surface. The diving board is slightly flexed downwards. The 'INDIANA' sign and spectators are visible in the background."

  "reasoning": "The frames depict a diver's progression from standing on the board to entering the water. \n\n1.  **Initial Stance (frame_4):** This frame shows the diver in a straight standing posture with the least water disturbance visible, suggesting it's the very beginning of the sequence, perhaps the initial placement on the board.\n2.  **Minor Movement/Adjustment (frame_3 then frame_0):** Frames 0 and 3 both show the diver standing with a small ripple or splash under their feet, indicating a slight movement or adjustment on the board (e.g., a small preparatory bounce). Comparing them closely, the splash in frame_3 appears slightly less developed or widespread than in frame_0, suggesting frame_3 occurs just before frame_0 as the movement progresses.\n3.  **Preparation for Jump (frame_1):** In this frame, the diver is visibly crouched, with knees bent and arms raised. The diving board is significantly more depressed, and there's a more pronounced splash/ripple under the board. This clearly indicates the diver is actively loading the board and preparing for the main jump.\n4.  **Water Entry (frame_2):** This is the final stage shown, with a large splash in the water where the diver entered, and the diver is no longer visible on the board. This unequivocally marks the end of the diving action in this sequence.\n\nTherefore, the logical progression based on the diver's action and the water disturbance is from a calm stance, through small adjustments, to a full jump preparation, and finally, the water entry.",
