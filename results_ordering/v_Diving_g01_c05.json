    "A diver is in mid-air, in a tucked position, descending towards the water. They are at a height roughly level with the diving board.",
    "A diver in dark swim trunks is walking along a springboard towards the end, beginning their approach for a dive.",
    "The diver is in a seated or deeply crouched position on the very end of the springboard, with their body bent forward.",
    "The diver is high in the air, well above the diving platform, at the apex of their jump. They are in a tucked rotational pose.",
    "The diver is balanced in a handstand on the end of the springboard, holding a static position before starting the dive."

  "reasoning": "The user wants me to determine the temporal order of 5 frames from a diving video. The frames show several distinct stages that do not fit a standard, well-executed dive. The most logical way to sequence these frames is to interpret them as a failed dive attempt.\n\n1.  **frame_1**: This is the clear beginning of the sequence. The diver is walking out onto the springboard, which is the standard 'approach' phase.\n2.  **frame_4**: After reaching the end of the board, the diver gets into a preparatory stance. Here, it's a handstand, indicating the diver is attempting a handstand dive.\n3.  **frame_2**: This frame is key to understanding the sequence. A successful handstand dive would not involve a seated position. Therefore, it's most likely that the diver loses balance, fails the handstand, and falls onto the board in this seated/crouched position.\n4.  **frame_3**: The impact of the fall (seen in frame_2) on the flexible springboard acts as an unintentional launch, propelling the diver into the air. This frame shows the diver at the highest point (apex) of this accidental trajectory.\n5.  **frame_0**: Following the law of physics, after reaching the apex of the jump in frame_3, the diver begins to descend towards the water. This frame shows them at a lower altitude than in frame_3, on their way down.\n\nThis \"diving fail\" narrative provides a coherent cause-and-effect timeline that connects all five otherwise inconsistent frames.",
