  "frame_descriptions": [
    "A diver stands relatively upright on the diving board, positioned towards the left side of the frame, facing the pool. The board is flat, and there's a slight ripple or splash in the water directly below the board, suggesting an initial setup or a very early stage of a dive sequence.",
    "A diver is in a tucked position in mid-air, very close to the water's surface, with their feet appearing to have just made contact or are about to make contact with the water, creating a significant splash. The diver's upper body is still largely above the water.",
    "A diver is in the process of taking off from the diving board. Their body is crouched, with arms extended backward, indicating they are propelling themselves upwards. The diving board is visibly flexed downwards, showing the force of the push-off.",
    "A diver is mostly submerged in the water, in a vertical, streamlined position, having entered headfirst. The body is elongated, and the entry splash is more contained or has begun to settle, indicating deeper penetration into the water.",
    "A diver is high in the air, above the diving board, performing an aerial maneuver such as a somersault or flip. Their body is tightly curled, and they are at the peak of their jump, some distance from both the board and the water."

  "reasoning": "The frames depict a single diving sequence. The logical progression of a dive includes preparation, takeoff, aerial maneuver, initial water entry, and deeper water penetration.\n\n1.  **Preparation/Initial Stance:** Frame_0 shows the diver standing on the board, in an initial position, preparing for the dive. The board is flat, and the diver is upright.\n2.  **Takeoff:** Frame_2 clearly shows the diver actively pushing off the board, which is visibly flexed downwards due to the force. This happens after the initial stance.\n3.  **Aerial Maneuver:** Frame_4 captures the diver at the highest point of the dive, in mid-air, performing a somersault or flip. This follows the takeoff.\n4.  **Initial Water Entry:** Frame_1 shows the diver in a tucked position, just making contact with the water's surface or very close to it, creating a large splash. This is the first impact with the water after the aerial phase.\n5.  **Deeper Water Penetration/Submergence:** Frame_3 shows the diver largely submerged, in a streamlined, headfirst position. The splash is more settled, indicating the diver has penetrated deeper into the water. This is the final stage of entry after the initial impact.",
