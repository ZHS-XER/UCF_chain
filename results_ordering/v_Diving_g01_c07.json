  "frame_descriptions": [
    "A diver is captured in mid-air, perfectly vertical with their head pointing down towards the swimming pool. They are very close to the water's surface, in the final moments before entry.",
    "A diver is in mid-air, having traveled away from the diving board. Their body is mostly horizontal but angled downwards, preparing for the entry into the water below.",
    "The diver is no longer visible, having completely entered the water. A splash and ripples on the surface of the blue pool indicate the point of entry.",
    "A diver is in a tight tuck position, just after leaving the high diving platform. They are still very close to the board and at the beginning of their descent.",
    "A diver is crouched on the edge of a high diving platform, which has \"INDIANA\" written on it. They are in the preparatory stance, about to begin their dive."
  ],
  "reasoning": "The logical sequence of a dive is to start on the diving board, jump off, travel through the air, enter the water, and then be submerged.\n1. Frame 4 shows the diver in the starting position, crouched on the board, making it the first frame.\n2. Frame 3 shows the diver just after leaving the board in a tuck position, which is the immediate next step.\n3. Frame 1 shows the diver further down and away from the board, in the middle of the dive's aerial phase.\n4. Frame 0 shows the diver in a straight, vertical position, just moments before hitting the water, which is the pre-entry phase.\n5. Frame 2 shows only the splash after the diver has entered the water, marking the end of the sequence.\nTherefore, the correct temporal order is 4, 3, 1, 0, 2.",
