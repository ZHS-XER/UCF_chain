  "frame_descriptions": [
    "This frame shows a diver just above the water surface, head-first, with significant splash and ripples indicating a recent or ongoing entry into the water. Their body is mostly vertical.",
    "This frame captures the diver in mid-air, horizontally oriented and relatively high above the water. They appear to be in the middle of a flip or twist, with no water disturbance visible yet.",
    "This frame shows the diver in the air, very close to the diving board. They are in a nearly vertical, head-down position, having just pushed off or beginning their descent towards the water.",
    "This frame depicts the water surface with ripples and bubbles, but the diver is completely submerged and not visible. This indicates a moment after the diver has entered the water.",
    "This frame shows a diver standing on the diving board, facing away from the camera and towards the water, in a preparatory stance before the dive."

  "reasoning": "The logical sequence of a dive starts with the diver on the board, then jumping, performing a maneuver in the air, entering the water, and finally being submerged. \n\n1.  **frame_4** clearly shows the diver on the diving board, ready to begin the dive. This is the initial state.\n2.  **frame_2** shows the diver having just pushed off the board, in a vertical, head-down position, beginning their descent.\n3.  **frame_1** captures the diver in mid-air, further away from the board and higher, performing a maneuver (like a flip or twist) before entering the water.\n4.  **frame_0** shows the diver making impact with the water or just entering, indicated by the splash and the diver's body partially submerged/at the surface.\n5.  **frame_3** shows the aftermath, where the diver is completely submerged, and only the ripples and bubbles on the surface remain. This is the final state among the given pictures.",
