  "frame_descriptions": [
    "A person is on a diving board, bending their knees and leaning slightly forward, poised for a jump. Their arms are slightly bent at the elbows, and their gaze is directed towards the water. The pool is in the foreground, and a grassy area with trees and a building is in the background.",
    "The person has just left the diving board and is in the air, slightly above the board. Their body is extended, with arms reaching backwards and upwards, indicating an upward trajectory after pushing off the board. The water below shows slight ripples.",
    "The person is higher in the air compared to frame_1. Their body is more vertical, with legs together and extended downwards, and arms raised above their head. This position suggests they are near the peak of their jump before fully transitioning into the dive.",
    "The person is significantly higher in the air and is now inverted. Their legs are pointed straight upwards, and their body is in a tight pike or tuck position, indicating the mid-air execution of a dive. The diving board is visible below them, now empty.",
    "The diving board is empty, and a visible splash is in the water directly below where the diver would have entered. The ripples in the water are more pronounced, suggesting the diver has just submerged or is in the process of entering the water."

  "reasoning": "The frames depict a sequence of a person performing a dive. I ordered them chronologically based on the physical actions of the diver and their position relative to the diving board and water.\n\n1.  **frame_0** shows the initial state: the diver is on the springboard, crouching and preparing to jump. This is the clear starting point.\n2.  **frame_1** follows immediately after, with the diver having just pushed off the board and beginning their upward movement, body extended.\n3.  **frame_2** shows the diver at a higher point in the air than in frame_1, still mostly upright but further into their upward trajectory. This is before the full inversion of the dive.\n4.  **frame_3** shows the diver at the peak of their dive, fully inverted and executing the dive's form (pike/tuck). This occurs after the initial jump and before water entry.\n5.  **frame_4** is the final visible action, where the diver is no longer in the air, and a splash is seen in the water, indicating they have entered the pool.",
