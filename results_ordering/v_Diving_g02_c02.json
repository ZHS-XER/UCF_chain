    "Frame_0 shows a person in the swimming pool with their head visible above the water. Another person is captured mid-dive, partially submerged or just entering the water from the diving board, creating a moderate splash. The diving board is to the left.",
    "Frame_1 shows a significant, large splash in the swimming pool where the diver would have entered. The diving board is now empty. The person who was already in the water (from frame_0) is still visible with their head above the water.",
    "Frame_2 shows a person standing on the far end of the diving board, facing away from the pool, seemingly preparing to jump or having just stepped onto the board. Another person is already in the water in the foreground, with their head visible.",
    "Frame_3 shows a person in mid-air, having just leaped from the diving board. They are relatively high above the water, with their body in an upright or slightly bent position. The person already in the water is visible.",
    "Frame_4 shows a person in mid-air, having jumped from the diving board. They are lower than in frame_3, descending towards the water, with their body in a more streamlined or slightly arcing position. The person already in the water is visible."

  "reasoning": "The sequence of events depicts a person performing a dive from a diving board. I ordered the frames based on the natural progression of a dive:\n\n1.  **Preparation/Starting Position**: The diver is on the board, preparing to jump. This is best represented by frame_2.\n2.  **Take-off/Ascent**: The diver has just left the board and is in the initial phase of the jump, relatively high above the water. This matches frame_3.\n3.  **Descent/Pre-entry**: The diver is descending towards the water, closer to the entry point than in the previous frame. This corresponds to frame_4.\n4.  **Water Entry/Initial Splash**: The diver is entering the water, causing an initial splash. The diver's body is partially visible entering the water. This is seen in frame_0.\n5.  **Post-Entry/Peak Splash**: The diver is fully submerged, and the splash from their entry has reached its maximum height or intensity. The diving board is now empty. This is clearly depicted in frame_1, which shows a much larger splash than frame_0.\n\nThe presence of another person already in the water serves as a consistent background element across all frames, helping to track the main diving action.",
