    "A person is in mid-air above a swimming pool, having just jumped off the diving board. They are beginning to rotate forward, with their body relatively straight.",
    "A person is standing at the end of a diving board, crouched with their arms pulled back, in preparation to jump into the swimming pool below.",
    "The person diving is further along in their mid-air rotation, tucked into a compact ball shape and positioned closer to the water's surface.",
    "A large splash is erupting from the surface of the pool directly below the diving board, indicating the diver has just entered the water. An edited-in fiery explosion effect is visible in the background.",
    "A person is in the process of leaving the diving board, having just pushed off with their feet. They are beginning their ascent into the air."

  "reasoning": "The frames show the sequence of a person diving into a pool. The logical order follows the physical progression of a dive. \n1. **Frame_1**: The person is on the diving board, preparing to jump. This is the starting position.\n2. **Frame_4**: The person is pushing off the board, launching themselves into the air. This is the take-off, immediately following the preparation.\n3. **Frame_0**: The person is airborne, just after leaving the board, beginning their forward motion. This is the early stage of the dive in the air.\n4. **Frame_2**: The person is further into their dive, tucked in a ball and closer to the water. This is a later stage of the mid-air portion of the dive.\n5. **Frame_3**: A large splash is visible in the water, signifying the end of the dive as the person enters the pool. The edited-in explosion also marks this moment of impact. This is the final frame of the action.",
