  "frame_descriptions": [
    "A diver is in mid-air, in a perfectly vertical, straight body position with arms extended above their head, poised just above the pool water. This appears to be the peak of their dive form before entry.",
    "A diver is airborne, in a horizontal position parallel to the water, having just launched off the diving board.",
    "A person stands at the very edge of a diving board, with knees slightly bent, preparing to execute a dive into the swimming pool below.",
    "The pool surface shows ripples and a small splash, indicating that a diver has just entered the water and is now fully submerged. The diver is not visible.",
    "A diver is captured mid-entry into the water, with their lower body already submerged and a splash forming around them as they descend."
  ],
  "reasoning": "The logical sequence of a dive is as follows:\n1. Preparation on the diving board.\n2. The initial jump and becoming airborne.\n3. Executing the dive form in mid-air.\n4. Entering the water.\n5. The aftermath of the dive, with the person submerged.\n\nFollowing this logic:\n- Frame_2 shows the person on the diving board, preparing to dive. This is the starting point.\n- Frame_1 shows the person just after leaving the board, in a horizontal position. This is the second step.\n- Frame_0 shows the person in a vertical, handstand-like position, which is a mid-air maneuver that occurs after the initial jump.\n- Frame_4 shows the diver entering the water, creating a splash. This happens after the mid-air portion of the dive.\n- Frame_3 shows only the ripples in the water after the diver has completely submerged. This is the final frame of the sequence.",
