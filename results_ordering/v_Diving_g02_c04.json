    "A person is standing on a diving platform with their back mostly to the camera, slightly turned towards the left side of the pool. Their arms are down by their sides. The pool surface shows a slight ripple.",
    "The diving platform is empty. A distinct splash is visible in the water directly below where the diver would have been, indicating a person has just entered the water. The water around the splash is disturbed.",
    "A person is standing on the diving platform with their back entirely to the camera. Their arms are slightly raised and held out from their body, suggesting a preparatory stance for a dive or a slight bounce. They are positioned closer to the edge than in frame 3 but further back than frame 0.",
    "A person is standing on the diving platform with their back completely to the camera. Their arms are down by their sides. They appear to be in a relaxed, initial standing position, possibly slightly further back from the edge.",
    "A person is captured in mid-air above the diving platform. Their body is arched, and their arms are raised and extended upwards, indicating they are in the process of a dive, having just sprung from the board."

  "reasoning": "The sequence of events describes a dive from a diving board into a pool. \n\n1.  **Initial Stance:** Frame 3 shows the diver standing on the platform with arms down, in an initial, relaxed position with their back fully to the camera. This is the earliest stage.\n2.  **Adjustment/Preparation (Arms Down):** Frame 0 shows the diver still with arms down, but slightly turned and perhaps a step closer to the edge, indicating a subtle adjustment from the initial stance.\n3.  **Active Preparation (Arms Up):** Frame 2 shows the diver with arms slightly raised, which is a common posture right before pushing off the board or during a preliminary bounce. This stage logically follows the standing positions with arms down.\n4.  **Mid-Air Jump:** Frame 4 captures the diver in the air, having clearly left the diving board. This is the peak action of the dive, occurring after all preparation on the board.\n5.  **Water Entry:** Frame 1 shows a splash in the water and the absence of the diver on the board, indicating the diver has entered the pool. This is the final stage depicted.",
