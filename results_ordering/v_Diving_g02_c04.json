    "A person is in the air, in the early phase of a jump from the poolside. They are in an upright posture, just above the ground level.",
    "The person has disappeared into the pool, and a large splash is visible in the water where they entered.",
    "A person is standing still at the edge of the swimming pool, looking down at the water, preparing to jump.",
    "The person is at the peak of their jump, high in the air above the poolside. They are in a tuck position, with their knees bent towards their chest.",
    "A person is walking towards the edge of the swimming pool, captured in mid-stride."
  ],
  "reasoning": "The logical sequence of events is a person preparing for and executing a jump into a pool. First, the person walks towards the pool's edge (frame_4). Next, they stand at the edge, poised to jump (frame_2). Then, they begin the jump, launching themselves into the air (frame_0). They reach the highest point of their jump, performing a tuck maneuver (frame_3). Finally, they enter the water, leaving only a splash (frame_1). The order is determined by following the person's position and action from approaching the pool to entering the water.",
