    "A view of a swimming pool with an empty diving board. A person in a black and white outfit sits in a chair on the pool deck. The water is relatively calm, with the ripples from a previous splash having mostly subsided.",
    "A female diver in a green and black swimsuit stands at the end of the diving board, her arms raised straight up, preparing to dive. A person sits in a chair on the deck, watching.",
    "The female diver is in mid-air, just after leaving the diving board. She is in an upward trajectory and a pike position. The diving board is recoiling upwards from her jump.",
    "The diving board is empty. There are distinct, fresh ripples in the water, indicating that the diver has just entered the pool.",
    "The female diver is at the apex of her jump, high above the diving board. She is in a compact tuck position, rotating forward."
  ],
  "reasoning": "The logical sequence of a dive is preparation, execution, and aftermath. \n1. **Frame 1** is the clear starting point, showing the diver on the board in a ready stance before the dive begins.\n2. **Frame 2** follows, capturing the moment just after the diver has sprung from the board, beginning her ascent.\n3. **Frame 4** shows the next phase of the dive, where the diver is at her highest point in the air, performing a tuck.\n4. **Frame 3** shows the immediate aftermath. The diver is no longer visible, and there are prominent ripples in the water where she entered.\n5. **Frame 0** is the final frame, showing a later moment when the ripples have largely dissipated, and the water is becoming calm again.",
