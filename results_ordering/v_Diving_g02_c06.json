    "A wide shot of a swimming pool area. In the foreground, a person is standing on a diving board with their back to the water, knees slightly bent, and arms raised above their head. The diving board is white, and the pool water is blue. In the background, there's a grassy area with a person sitting on a mat, and some trees and structures.",
    "A wide shot of the swimming pool area. The person is now in mid-air above the diving board, in a tucked somersault position, performing a dive. The diving board is visible below them, and the pool water is blue. A person is still sitting on a mat in the background.",
    "A wide shot of the swimming pool area. A person is standing very upright and poised on the diving board with their back to the water, arms fully extended high above their head. The diving board is white, and the pool water is blue. A person is sitting on a mat in the grassy background.",
    "A wide shot of the swimming pool area. The diving board is now empty. There are visible ripples and disturbance in the pool water near where the diver would have entered, suggesting a recent entry. A person is still sitting on a mat in the background.",
    "A wide shot of the swimming pool area. The diving board is empty. The pool water is relatively calm, with only minor ripples compared to frame_3, indicating that some time has passed since any disturbance. A person is sitting on a mat in the background."

  "reasoning": "The sequence depicts a person performing a dive from a diving board. \n\n1.  **frame_2** shows the initial pose: the person is standing very straight and poised on the diving board, arms fully extended upwards, indicating the beginning of their preparation for the dive.\n2.  **frame_0** follows the initial pose: the person is still on the board, but their knees are slightly bent, and the body appears more dynamic, suggesting they are in the process of springing or bouncing off the board, gathering momentum for the jump.\n3.  **frame_1** is the mid-air phase: the person is clearly off the board and in the air, performing a tucked somersault, which is the execution of the dive.\n4.  **frame_3** shows the immediate aftermath of the entry: the diving board is empty, and there are significant splashes and ripples in the water, indicating the person has just entered the pool.\n5.  **frame_4** represents the final stage among these frames: the diving board is still empty, but the water has become much calmer than in frame_3, suggesting that more time has passed since the diver entered the water and the ripples have begun to subside.",
