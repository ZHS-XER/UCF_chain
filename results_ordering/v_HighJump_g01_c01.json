    "A wide shot of an indoor track facility. An athlete in light-colored clothing is in the middle of their run-up for a high jump, moving from right to left, and getting close to the jump point.",
    "The athlete is at the apex of their high jump, positioned horizontally with their back arched as they clear the bar. A person in a grey hoodie watches from the left foreground.",
    "A wide shot of the indoor track facility, showing the athlete in an earlier stage of their run-up, further from the high jump apparatus than in the previous wide shot.",
    "The athlete is in the take-off phase of the high jump. Their body is angled upwards as they propel themselves over the bar. The person in the grey hoodie is visible on the left.",
    "A wide shot showing the athlete at the very beginning of their run-up for the high jump. They are a small figure in the distance, on the right side of the frame, starting to run towards the left."

  "reasoning": "The sequence of events for a high jump is the approach run, the take-off, clearing the bar, and landing. The frames can be ordered by following the athlete's progression through these stages.\n\n1.  **frame_4**: This is the earliest frame, showing the athlete at the start of their run-up, farthest from the high jump bar.\n2.  **frame_2**: The athlete has moved further along their run-up, closer to the jump area than in frame_4.\n3.  **frame_0**: The athlete is now at the end of their approach run, just before the take-off. This is the last of the wide-angle shots showing the run-up.\n4.  **frame_3**: The camera has panned to follow the athlete, who is now in the take-off phase, pushing off the ground and beginning their ascent over the bar.\n5.  **frame_1**: This is the peak of the action. The athlete is horizontal, arching their back over the bar to clear it. This logically follows the take-off in frame_3.\n\nTherefore, the correct temporal order is based on the athlete's movement from the start of the run to the peak of the jump.",
