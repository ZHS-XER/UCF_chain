    "A high jump athlete is suspended in mid-air, having cleared the bar using the Fosbury Flop technique. Their back is arched over the bar, which is visible. A large red landing mat is directly behind them. The athlete is wearing dark athletic attire.",
    "An athlete, likely a high jumper, is captured in motion, running across a grey gym floor. They are wearing a dark singlet and shorts, with arms pumping as they accelerate. The background shows spectators and the general gym environment, but the high jump bar and mat are not clearly in this close-up shot of the runner.",
    "A wide, elevated shot of a large indoor gymnasium during an event. Numerous spectators line the walls. A basketball court layout is visible on the grey floor. In the far left distance, the red high jump landing mat and uprights can be faintly seen. This provides an overall view of the venue.",
    "A slightly closer or lower-angle shot compared to frame_2, still showing a wide view of the gym and spectators. The high jump landing mat and bar, with its uprights, are more clearly visible on the left side of the frame, indicating the area of focus for the event. The basketball court lines are also prominent.",
    "An athlete is descending towards the red landing mat, having just cleared the high jump bar. Their body is somewhat upright, with arms raised. The high jump uprights are clearly visible next to the athlete. This frame captures the immediate aftermath of clearing the bar, as the athlete prepares for impact on the mat."

  "reasoning": "The frames depict a high jump event. The most logical temporal order follows the progression of a typical high jump attempt, starting from a general overview of the venue, narrowing in on the event area, showing the athlete's approach, the peak of the jump, and finally the descent/landing.\n\n1.  **frame_2:** This is the widest and highest-angle shot, providing a general establishing view of the gymnasium and the event from a distance. The high jump mat is barely visible in the far left.\n2.  **frame_3:** This shot is slightly closer or at a lower angle than frame_2, bringing the high jump area (mat and bar) into clearer focus on the left side, preparing the viewer for the action.\n3.  **frame_1:** An athlete is shown in motion, running. This represents the beginning of their approach or run-up phase for the high jump.\n4.  **frame_0:** The athlete is captured at the peak of their jump, clearing the bar using the Fosbury Flop technique. This is the climax of the action.\n5.  **frame_4:** The athlete is shown immediately after clearing the bar, descending towards the landing mat. This marks the conclusion of the jump action.",
