  "frame_descriptions": [
    "This frame presents a wide shot of an indoor gymnasium or track facility. A large white 'NCAA' sign is visible on the far wall. Along the left wall, a group of spectators or officials are standing. The floor has markings for both a basketball court and track lanes. Some equipment is vaguely visible on the right side.",
    "This frame shows a general view of the indoor track, but from a lower and slightly closer perspective than frame_0 or frame_3. The foreground shows clear track lines. A scoreboard is visible on the far wall. A group of people are standing in the mid-ground along the wall. The camera angle is different, emphasizing the track surface.",
    "This frame focuses on a high jump or pole vault setup. A large red landing mat is prominent on the left, with white uprights and a bar stand visible. A person is standing near the mat. Other individuals are in the background, but no active jumping is occurring. The ceiling structure with large dark vents is visible.",
    "This frame is very similar to frame_0, offering a wide shot of the indoor gymnasium with the 'NCAA' sign on the far wall. A group of people are gathered along the left wall. The track lines and basketball court markings are visible on the floor. Slight differences in the grouping of people or camera position might be present compared to frame_0.",
    "This frame is very similar to frame_2, focusing on the high jump setup with the red mat and uprights. However, in this frame, an athlete is actively running towards the high jump bar, mid-stride, indicating the event is in progress."

  "reasoning": "The core logic for ordering these frames is to move from general establishing shots of the venue to specific action shots of an event.\n\n1.  **Establishing Shots (General Views):** Frames 0, 1, and 3 are general views of the indoor track/gym. Frames 0 and 3 are very similar wide shots, showing the 'NCAA' sign and groups of people. Frame 1 is also a general view but from a different, lower angle, emphasizing the track lines and showing a scoreboard.\n2.  **Event-Specific Shots (High Jump):** Frames 2 and 4 are focused on a specific event, the high jump. Frame 2 shows the setup (mat, uprights) with people nearby but no active jump. Frame 4 shows an athlete in motion, actively performing the jump.\n\n**Temporal Ordering:**\n*   It's logical to start with wide, general establishing shots of the venue. `frame_0` and `frame_3` are good candidates. `frame_0` appears to be a slightly earlier or initial wider view, with `frame_3` showing minor shifts in crowd position, suggesting a slight progression. So, `frame_0` then `frame_3` seems plausible.\n*   Following the wide shots, `frame_1` provides another general view but from a closer, different angle, focusing more on the track and scoreboard, further establishing the environment before zooming into specific action.\n*   Next, the video would likely transition to the specific event. `frame_2` shows the high jump setup with no one actively jumping, indicating a moment before or between attempts, setting the scene for the action.\n*   Finally, `frame_4` captures the actual action, with an athlete in motion during the high jump. This logically follows the setup shot.\n\nTherefore, the sequence moves from wide establishing shots to a closer general view, then to the setup of a specific event, and finally to the action of that event.",
