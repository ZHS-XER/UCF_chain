    "A person is at the apex of a high jump, positioned directly over the bar with their back arched as they begin to clear it.",
    "A wide shot of an indoor track and field area, showing an athlete in the distance at the beginning of the high jump runway, preparing for their approach.",
    "The person has successfully cleared the high jump bar and is now descending backwards, about to land on the large red mat below.",
    "The person is in the early phase of their jump, having just taken off. They are ascending towards the bar, which is to their left.",
    "The person is captured mid-stride during their approach run on the track, moving towards the high jump area."

  "reasoning": "The logical sequence of a high jump event is used to determine the order. The event begins with the athlete at the start of the runway, far from the bar (frame_1). The next logical step is the athlete running towards the bar during their approach (frame_4). Following the run, the athlete takes off and begins to ascend (frame_3). The climax of the jump is when the athlete is at the peak, clearing the bar (frame_0). The final action is the athlete falling onto the landing mat after clearing the bar (frame_2). Therefore, the correct chronological order is 1, 4, 3, 0, 2.",
