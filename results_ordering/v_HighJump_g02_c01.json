    "A female athlete in a black sports outfit is standing on a red track, looking poised, with her left foot slightly forward. She is in an indoor sports facility, with blue walls and other people visible in the background. The text 'Girls High Jump' is at the bottom right.",
    "The female athlete is captured mid-run on the red track, leaning forward with her arms swinging, indicating active motion. She is wearing a black outfit. In the background, other people and equipment are visible. The text 'Girls High Jump' is at the bottom right.",
    "The female athlete is shown running vigorously on the track, with her body angled and her legs in a powerful stride. Her right leg is extended backward, and her left leg is bent forward, suggesting a strong push-off or final phase of her run-up. The text 'Girls High Jump' is at the bottom right.",
    "The female athlete is mid-air, soaring over a high jump bar, with her back arched and legs raised, in the typical 'Fosbury Flop' style. The image is slightly blurred due to motion, capturing the peak action of the jump. A blue landing mat is visible below her.",
    "A female athlete in a black athletic outfit is walking or standing, looking towards the camera, on a red track. She appears to be further back from the immediate high jump area compared to other frames. Other individuals are visible in the background. No action text is present in this frame, only the background elements."

  "reasoning": "The frames depict a high jump sequence, from preparation to clearing the bar. I ordered them by analyzing the athlete's posture, movement, and position relative to the high jump area.\n\n1.  **Frame 4 (Initial Position/Preparation):** The athlete is standing or walking casually, appearing most relaxed and furthest from the high jump bar. This typically represents the very beginning of the sequence, before an approach.\n2.  **Frame 0 (Start of Approach):** The athlete is now poised at what appears to be the starting point of her run-up, facing the direction of the jump. She is not yet in full motion but is clearly preparing.\n3.  **Frame 1 (Early Run-up):** The athlete is actively running, with her body leaning forward and arms swinging, indicating she is gaining speed in her approach towards the bar.\n4.  **Frame 2 (Late Run-up/Pre-takeoff):** The athlete is in a more powerful, extended running stride, suggesting she is in the final, most forceful phase of her run-up, just before takeoff. Her body position indicates a strong push.\n5.  **Frame 3 (Clearing the Bar):** This frame clearly shows the athlete mid-air, having successfully lifted herself over the high jump bar. This is the climax of the high jump action.",
