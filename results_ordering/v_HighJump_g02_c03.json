  "frame_descriptions": [
    "A close-up, slightly blurry shot of an athlete in a black uniform and yellow shoes as they are in mid-air, clearing the high jump bar. The vertical support pole is prominent in the foreground.",
    "The athlete is walking on the red track, away from the high jump area, looking back over their shoulder. Spectators and officials are seated in the background.",
    "The athlete stands in front of the blue high jump landing mat, looking up at the orange and white bar, appearing to be mentally preparing for their jump.",
    "The athlete is in a full sprint on the red track, running towards the high jump apparatus. Their body is angled forward, indicating the run-up phase of the jump.",
    "The athlete has successfully cleared the bar and is now landing on their back on the large blue mat. The bar is still in its place above them."
  ],
  "reasoning": "The frames depict a single high jump attempt. The logical sequence of events in a high jump is as follows:\n1.  **Preparation:** The athlete stands before the bar to focus and prepare. This is shown in frame_2.\n2.  **Run-up:** The athlete sprints towards the bar to generate momentum. This is depicted in frame_3.\n3.  **The Jump/Flight:** The athlete launches themselves over the bar. Frame_0 captures the moment they are clearing the bar.\n4.  **Landing:** After clearing the bar, the athlete lands on the mat. This is shown in frame_4.\n5.  **Post-Jump:** The athlete gets off the mat and walks away. Frame_1 shows the athlete walking away after the attempt is complete.\nTherefore, the correct chronological order is 2, 3, 0, 4, 1.",
