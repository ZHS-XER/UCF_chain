    "A male athlete in a black and red uniform is in the middle of his approach run on a red track for a high jump.",
    "The athlete has landed on his back on the blue mat after a failed jump, with the dislodged bar lying next to him.",
    "The athlete is mid-air, falling backwards onto the blue landing mat, with the high jump bar falling alongside him. The image is blurry due to motion.",
    "The athlete is at the apex of his jump, arching his back as he attempts to clear the red and white high jump bar.",
    "A male athlete begins his curved approach run on a red track towards the high jump apparatus."
  ],
  "reasoning": "The logical order of a high jump event starts with the approach run, followed by the jump, the descent, and the landing. Frame 4 shows the beginning of the run, as the athlete is furthest from the high jump bar. Frame 0 shows the athlete closer to the bar, continuing the run just before takeoff. Frame 3 captures the peak of the jump as the athlete arches his back to go over the bar. Frame 2 shows the athlete and the bar falling together after he has hit it, indicating a failed attempt. Finally, frame 1 shows the athlete having landed on the blue mat with the fallen bar, which is the final moment of the sequence.",
